    <abstract>
      <t>This document attempts to specify current DNS protocol in
      squashed form in a single document.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="About this document">
      <t>Current DNS protocol is spread over several RFCs and drafts
      dating back to 1987 (beginning from <xref target="RFC1033" />,
      <xref target="RFC1034" />, <xref target="RFC1035" />). There is no
      structure and order to be found in the publication of these
      RFCs. The early DNS RFCs are insufficiently specified and some
      parts of intermediate RFCs are obsolete. The internet has changed
      significantly since 1987 and there are several security
      considerations when implementing public-facing DNS. Learning the
      DNS protocol pedantically for the purpose of implementing it is
      very very difficult, and navigating the RFCs without any
      consistent ordering or rationale is at best confusing to a
      newcomer.</t>

      <t>This document attempts to provide a single structured reference
      of the current "core" DNS protocol, squashing together the
      contents and errata of the various DNS RFCs and drafts. It also
      attempts to clarify DNS protocol where ambiguity exists.</t>

      <t>It is expected that implementors and anybody who is interested
      in protocol behavior will consult this document.</t>

      <t>Following the robustness principle ("Be conservative in
      what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others"), an
      implementation that follows the behavior in this document is
      expected to be compatible when talking with current
      implementations of DNS.</t>

      <t>As everything is described here, this document need not
      contain any normative references to older DNS RFCs and drafts, but
      for the sake of citation, the source of requirements (where
      applicable) is provided.</t>

      <t>This document does not attempt to describe aspects such as the
      history of DNS, operating system functions and API for DNS
      operations, DNS utilities, etc. It is meant to be a pedantic
      network protocol description only.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
      "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
      described in BCP14 <xref target="RFC2119" /> <xref
      target="RFC8174" /> when, and only when, they appear in all
      capitals, as shown here.</t>
